# Greyscale_Conversion_Program
Convert a color image to a greyscale image.

This program was designed as a quick test of the Processing programming language (http://processing.org), and will require Processing to run. 

You'll need to import the ControlP5 library and install it in your Processing libraries directory ( http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/ ).

After running the program, you'll be prompted to select an image. After selecting the image, press 'ENTER' or 'RETURN' to convert to greyscale, and click anywhere to terminate the program. The updated image will be saved in the same directory as the program. 

The intent of this program is to get more familiar with the Processing PDE and eventually create a more robust image processor for use with drawing plotters.
